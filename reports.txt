Open-Source reports for libraries:

---Frontend---

React: 

a.) What does this technology accomplish?
React is very useful for our team because of it's easy to use state management. You can make
a state variable and whenever it changes, it automatically changes in the UI. Our webapp 
relies heavily on different states so choosing React to handle these different states is very useful.
b.) How does this technology accomplish what it does?
React uses what is known as a virtual DOM. A DOM is the rendered HTML that the user sees. With a virtual DOM, 
the DOM is essentialy Javascript and is able to reactively change. When something is changed in the virtulal DOM
and compare it to the actual DOM and update it to a snapshot of the virtual DOM with miminal changes. If you look
at the index.html file created by React, it has a singular div with the id of root. That's because everything
React-based in the webapp resides in this singular div. Otherwise, index.html is more or less a basic html file.
The react then works based on this within, the index.js file which takes that root div and applies the react DOM
to it with the reactDom.render method.
c.) What license(s) or terms of service apply to this technology?
React is created by Facebook and is licensed under MIT.

MomentJS:

a.) What does this technology accomplish?
Moment is used in our case to get the current date and the date system entirely. Dates can be found out manually 
but allowing MomentJS to figure it out for us is much, much easier. Parsing data is as simple as a function call.
b.) How does this technology accomplish what it does?
MomentJS takes the local date and makes it into it's own object to modify its output with functions. In the moment.js
file in the moment folder, the HTML5 input of the current date is inputted and moment creates its own object based on 
that. You then can call different methods on that date object. For example, if you want to see if a date is before another,
you would call the isBefore() function which is located in the compare.js file. This function parsed the date object inti
milliseconds and compares the two dates with a simple boolean if the milliseconds is larger or smaller than the other.
c.) What license(s) or terms of service apply to this technology?
MomentJS was created by the JS foundation and is licensed under MIT. It is open source and the user is allowed to modify it
free of charge.

---Backend---

Flask:

a.) What does this technology accomplish?
FLask is a WSGI micro-framework that allows us to use tools that we need if we need them.
We use it to connect frontend to backend and it handles connections that is sent from react.
It handles connections between database and the front end.
b.) How does this technology accomplish what it does?
Flask is at its core just a skeleton where it does not depend on anything. It makes no decisions on how the website
should run. This allows us a lot of freedom in what we use.
c.) What license(s) or terms of service apply to this technology?
Flask's license is licensed under BSD. You are permitted to modify it as long
as the Flask disclaimer is present and you do not promote the original author's 
of Flask for the derivatves you make of Flask.

Bcrypt:

a.) What does this technology accomplish?
Bcrypt is used to hash the passwords for our backend. Using this, passwords are never stored in plain text which would
pose a huge security risk. When logging in, the passwords are compares to the hashed password as well, to ensure satisfactory 
security.
b.) How does this technology accomplish what it does?
The salt and password are inputted to first set up the proccess of hashing the password. It runs a proccess where the password
is stretched, called key stretching. Then, a value is selected and encrypted into the extended password 64 times. The output of this
process is the hashed password. In this process, Bcrpy also uses 'salt' which gives you different hashes for the same input which is 
adds a whole new layer of security. You may ask how verifying passwords work if salting gives you a different hash? The salt is 
actually stored in the hash itself. So when comparing if a password matches a hash, it uses the salt given in the original hash to apply
to the password you are trying to verify.
c.) What license(s) or terms of service apply to this technology?
Bcrypt is licensed under an Apache license. This grants people general commerical use of the product along with their own modification.

JWT: 
a.) What does this technology accomplish?
This library allows us to create unique tokens to send to our frontend and database to verify a login session. It is much easier
than manually creating our unique token that can't be guessed by anyone.
b.) How does this technology accomplish what it does?
When creating a JWT an alogorithm is needed. In our case, HS256. This means the token will be signed with SHA256. First the token is encoded
with the base 64 encoding system. This is not secure enough of course and then our paremeter alogorithm, HS256, is used to apply and encode the 
token even further.
c.) What license(s) or terms of service apply to this technology?
JWT is licesned under the MIT license and allows for standard commerical use and modification.
